Open source doubly linked list ADT. Written in C.
=================================================

I have written this ADT to show the readers of my software development blog
how you would go about building a doubly linked list in the C programming language.

I have tried to keep this as robust as possible by utilizing void pointers to
allow you to create linked lists of any type, even your own custom types.

Since I provide no warranty for this code, by using it, you are agreeing to the
terms outlined in the DISCLAIMER.

Build command : gcc dlist.c test.c -o test

Other than that. Have fun with this code, and be sure to let me know if
you use my ADT do something cool : Leam@xanthu.com
